# Remote-Control-Forklift

Hi, the following is the documentation about my coolest project during a co-op at [The Raymond Corporation](raymondcorp.com).
The company is a part of Toyota Material Handling family and makes electric forklifts. I had the opportunity to work with them and put my python programming, hardware background to the test. 

For this project I developed a Python script which consisted an integration of a GUI(tkinter) and CAN library to send and receive can communition to and fro remote controller and a receiver (endpoint controller) on the truck.  

The following links are the devices being used for this project.
